# [txt-secure.fr](https://txt-secure.fr) front end
A service to securely share text data, where data is encrypted/decrypted in browser so that server has zero knowledge of it.

Started as a modernization of kpaste from Infomaniak while it was still using outdated stuff (https://github.com/Infomaniak/kpaste/issues/11), \
it ended up as a complete rewrite, with streamlined UI and code.

This is not directly useable as is (public assets and back end are not provided).

Building it produces the same files than the ones used online.
